# Weather_Based_Smart_Fan
This repository contains the technical documentation for my third year B.Tech CSE project titled "Weather-Based Smart Fan".

## Project Overview
The Weather-Based Smart Fan is an automated fan system designed to adjust its speed based on environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. It aims to provide energy efficiency and comfort by using sensor inputs to intelligently regulate fan speed. The system employs a microcontroller for sensor integration and control logic implementation.

## Key Features
- Automatic fan speed adjustment based on real-time temperature and humidity
- Sensor-driven system using DHT11 for climate readings
- Microcontroller-based control logic by using Arduino
- Low power consumption and eco-friendly design
- Focus on user comfort without manual intervention

## My Contribution

#### I was responsible for:
- Completing the technical paper
- Compiling and finalizing the project report
- Ensuring the documentation met academic and formatting standards
- Organizing the submission process and coordinating all written deliverables
This work reflects a culmination of my learnings and practical application of embedded systems and automation in a real-world use case.
